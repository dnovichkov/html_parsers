This project works with Python3.

It's recommended to setup virtual environment. Here are some links:
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and 
[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Example for Windows:

```
python -m venv env
cd env/Scripts
activate.bat
```

Then return to source directory and install necessary modules:

```
cd ../../
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Congratulations, now it is possible to run script:
```
python some_script.py
```
